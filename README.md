# Hello there, I'm Raphael 

At 19 years old, I'm still in an educational phase. I embarked on my programming journey in late 2022 with Minecraft. Currently, I'm a dual-study student in computer science, actively contributing to the [Uroria Network](https://github.com/Uroria) and [Code0](https://github.com/code0-tech). I consider myself a creative individual, finding my main motivation in programming from the ability to craft something out of nothing, fueled by nothing more than my brain and a good cup of coffee.

## Facts (since Februar 18th, 2024)
Now lets get to the ground of my programming skills!

Can't get more honest than this for my personal use. Additionally, I use C# and .NET Framework at work. I'm primarily focused on backend development (Java & C#), but I'm always open to diving into frontend tasks when needed.

## My plans for the future
- Diving deeper into safer programming with Rust.
- Elevating my Java & C# skills to the next level.
- Developing a portfolio and a mobile app.
