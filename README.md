# Hello there, I'm Raphael 

At 21 years old, I'm still in an educational phase. I embarked on my programming journey in late 2022 with Minecraft. Currently, I'm a dual-study student in computer science, actively contributing to [Code0](https://github.com/code0-tech). I consider myself a creative individual, finding my main motivation in programming from the ability to craft something out of thin air.
